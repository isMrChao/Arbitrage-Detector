# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We meet once or twice every week through zoom or in person. If someone is absent from the team meeting for any reason, they should alert the group members ahead of time so that no one in the group feels there is a lack of communication.

2. **Assistance** 
    We will assign roles each week so that everyone has a chance to participate and will collaborate to find a solution when something is difficult.


3. **Respect** 
    Every one should respect others' opinions. We function best in groups when all voices and ideas are heard in order to create the most efficient and respectful working environment. We really hope our group can communicate clearly and effectively so that ideas are shared amongst the team.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    We will avoid unequal distribution of work among group members. We will have an open discussion about team roles for each week at the beginning of the week so that no one feels as though they have an undue burden or are excluded from the work.

5. **Time Commitment** 
    2 to 5 hours per week is expected. Conflicts will be adrressed during regular meetings.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    We will welcome different ideas in a constructive way and avoid arguments.  There would be a vote when disagreement happens. And topics related to the conflict would be brought to the regular meeting to come up with a solution.
